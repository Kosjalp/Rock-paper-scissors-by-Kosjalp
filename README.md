**Due to an error, releases 1.0-1.1.0 are identical**

*Requirements*<br/>
-Python 3.6+<br/>
-VSCode<br/>

*Info* <br/>
This python script will save files to your computer. You can delete them at any time, however they can regenerate with new info.
The regeneration of the files will only contain a couple words and will only regenerate when running the python file.
The files will only take 10KB max however they will in most cases be only up to 1KB.
You can also use the files for info, hence why they even exist. History.txt contains info about your computer username and when you ran the python file. (**This info stays on your computer and only your computer.**)
This project was made and intender for VSCode and might not work on other coding platforms. Remember to set your open workplace folder to the folder where the script is stored. You can also do the whatever equivalent there is on other coding platforms.
