This python script will save files to your computer. You can delete them at any time, however they will regenerate with new info.
The regeneration of the files will only contain the title of the file and will only regenerate when rerunning the python file.
The files should only take 10KB max however they will in most cases be only up to 1KB.
You can also use the files for info, hence why they even exist. For example: history.txt contains info about your computer username and when you turned on the python file. (**This info stays on your computer and only your computer.**)
Remember to set your open workplace folder to the folder where the python script is stored, as that folder is where the files will be stored.
